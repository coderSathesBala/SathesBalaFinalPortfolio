<p class = "project Description">
  While working in the restaurant industry I wanted to create a Web Application which
  is relatable to what I am doing right now. While working at a restaurant I often find
  myself in situations where I am constantly eating out, building this recipe app helped me
  find healthier dishes I could create on my own while working on my coding skills. This
  is the second React Project I have built, in the first one I used classes to get all the work
  done, during this Recipe App I decided to use Hooks instead in order to gain a better understanding.
  I love using hooks this project has cleaner code compared to my last project where I was using classes.
  React is awesome to use and I would love to continue using it!

<p class = "project Languages">React.js</p>
<p class = "project Description">
  A project built in March 2019 which grabs the current most popular movies of each
  genre from an API called The Movie DataBase. I built this project in order to put my
  React.js skills to use & be able to show future employers my React skills. After building this project I
  see why huge companies such as Facebook & Instagram use React. I understand componentDidMount, axios and React
  in general a lot more after finishing this project. The more I understand leads me to enjoy coding a lot more,
  I would love to dive more in to React in future projects and see all the cool stuff I can build!

<!-- FIRST PROJECT -->

<div class="project Whole" id="firstProjectWhole">
<p class = "project Title">PlateAgain 2017</p>
<p class = "project Languages">Ruby On Rails + JavaScript</p>
<p class = "project Description">
   An​ interactive​ Ruby​ on​ Rails​ app​ created​ by​ a ​ ​
   group​ of​ five individuals,​ solving​ food​ waste​ in​
   Toronto.​ PlateAgain​ allows​ user to​ either​ log​
   in​ as​ a “provider”​ with​ an​ excess​ amount​ of​ food ​
   or an “acceptor”​ which​ is​ any​ sort​ of​ food​ bank​ or
   ​​charity​ organization which​ would​ make​ the​
   food​ useful.​ ​Both​ these​ users​ can communicate
   ​and​ ​​​view each​ other’s​ location​ in​ PlateAgain.
   This was my first app created with a group
   it was great to see what the process is like
   to work with other people and how the code I
   write can affect the whole group/project. Clean
   code is very effective throughout the creation
   process and learning to work with GitHub without
   overwriting other peoples work is a valuable lesson.</p>

  An​ interactive​ game​ created​ for​ entertainment, ​ ​
  NeoWallJump is a game inspired by Super Metroid
  +Matrix made during the GlobalJam 2018 Toronto
  2018 (48 Hour Hack- athon). The objective of the
  game is to get to the top of the wall through wall
  jumps while avoiding the falilng objects. It was
  cool to work with skilled developers who have been
  in the industry for multiple years, their style of
  code and work ethic is something for me to learn from.

<div class="project Whole">
<p class = "project Title">Hangman 2017</p>
<p class = "project Languages">JavaScript</p>
<p class = "project Description">
  An​ interactive​ game​ created​ for​ entertainment ​ ​
  purposes​ using HTML, CSS,​ Javascript​ & jQuery. ​ ​
  Hangman​ follows​ the​ concept​ of the​ original ​ ​
  game​ Hangman,​ with​ users​ guessing​ basketball​ teams.
  This was my first individul app created after
  learning how to use JavaScript through a Udemy
  course after graduating from a bootcamp. It was
  great to work on a project as an individual,
  after creating this project I realized how much
  more I love and feel comfortable with JavaScript
  compared to Ruby On Rails. This project is what
  steered me towards learning more JavaScript, Node.js
  and React.js. It was a fun project to create and
  show friends and family the skills that I have,
  also a fun game to play when I'm bored. </p>

<div class="project Whole">
<p class = "project Title">CSS GRID 2018</p>
<p class = "project Languages">HTML + CSS</p>
<p class = "project Description">
  CSS Grid is an application I created in order to
  further my understanding of CSS Grid and improve
  my front end development skills. One of the
  benefits I found from CSS Grid is that it allows
  for complete control over layout placement which
  is extremely useful when creating websites. I
  personally prefer CSS grid over Bootstrap, I
  feel like I have more control over placing
  objects. I also like how easily I can make
  websites responsive. </p>
