<!-- FIRST PROJECT -->
<div class="projectWholeLeft">
<p class = "projectTitleLeft">PlateAgain</p>
<p class = "projectLanguagesLeft">Ruby On Rails + JavaScript</p>
<p class = "projectDescriptionLeft">
   An​ interactive​ Ruby​ on​ Rails​ app​ created​ by​ a ​<br>​ ​
   group​ of​ five individuals,​ solving​ food​ waste​ in​ ​<br>
   Toronto.​ PlateAgain​ allows​ user to​ either​ log​ <br>
   in​ as​ a “provider”​ with​ an​ excess​ amount​ of​ food​ <br> ​
   or an “acceptor”​ which​ is​ any​ sort​ of​ food​ bank​ or​ <br>
   ​​charity​ organization which​ would​ make​ the​ <br>
   food​ useful.​ ​Both​ these​ users​ can communicate<br>
   ​and​ ​​​view each​ other’s​ location​ in​ PlateAgain.<br>
   This was my first app created with a group <br>
   it was great to see what the process is like <br>
   to work with other people and how the code I <br>
   write can affect the whole group/project. Clean <br>
   code is very effective throughout the creation <br>
   process and learning to work with GitHub without <br>
   overwriting other peoples work is a valuable lesson.</p>

<!-- PROJECT TWO -->
<div class="projectWholeRight">
<p class = "projectTitleRight">NeoWall</p>
<p class = "projectLanguagesRight">JavaScript + Pixel.Js</p>
<p class = "projectDescriptionRight">
  An​ interactive​ game​ created​ for​ entertainment, <br>​ ​
  NeoWallJump is a game inspired by Super Metroid <br>
  +Matrix made during the GlobalJam 2018 Toronto <br>
  2018 (48 Hour Hack- athon). The objective of the <br>
  game is to get to the top of the wall through wall <br>
  jumps while avoiding the falilng objects. It was <br>
  cool to work with skilled developers who have been <br>
  in the industry for multiple years, their style of <br>
  code and work ethic is something for me to learn from.

<!-- PROJECT THREE -->
<div class="projectWholeLeft">
<p class = "projectTitleLeft">Hangman</p>
<p class = "projectLanguagesLeft">JavaScript</p>
<p class = "projectDescriptionLeft">
  An​ interactive​ game​ created​ for​ entertainment <br>​ ​
  purposes​ using HTML, CSS,​ Javascript​ & jQuery. <br>​ ​
  Hangman​ follows​ the​ concept​ of the​ original <br>​ ​
  game​ Hangman,​ with​ users​ guessing​ basketball​ teams. <br>
  This was my first individul app created after <br>
  learning how to use JavaScript through a Udemy <br>
  course after graduating from a bootcamp. It was <br>
  great to work on a project as an individual, <br>
  after creating this project I realized how much<br>
  more I love and feel comfortable with JavaScript <br>
  compared to Ruby On Rails. This project is what <br>
  steered me towards learning more JavaScript, Node.js <br>
  and React.js. It was a fun project to create and <br>
  show friends and family the skills that I have, <br>
  also a fun game to play when I'm bored. </p>

<!-- PROJECT FOUR -->
<div class="projectWholeRight">
<p class = "projectTitleRight">CSS GRID</p>
<p class = "projectLanguagesRight">HTML + CSS</p>
<p class = "projectDescriptionRight">
  CSS Grid is an application I created in order to <br>
  further my understanding of CSS Grid and improve <br>
  my front end development skills. One of the <br>
  benefits I found from CSS Grid is that it allows <br>
  for complete control over layout placement which <br>
  is extremely useful when creating websites. I <br>
  personally prefer CSS grid over Bootstrap, I <br>
  feel like I have more control over placing <br>
  objects. I also like how easily I can make <br>
  websites responsive. </p>

<!-- PROJECT FIVE -->
<div class="projectWholeLeft">
<p class = "projectTitleLeft">Currency</p>
<p class = "projectLanguagesLeft">Wordpress</p>
<p class = "projectDescriptionLeft">​ ​
  My first freelance job I created for a Currency <br>
  Converter business. I've heard a lot of people say <br>
  that Web Developement is not a promising career <br>
  because of sites like SquareSpace, Wix and the <br>
  use of Wordpress allowing users with no coding <br>
  knowledge to create websites. After using <br>
  Wordpress I realized that this is not true There <br>
  will always be companies thatneed much more than <br>
  just a simple website built created by templates. <br>
  Web Development isn't dying but it is changing <br>
  and these new methods of creating websites does <br>
  make it easier to create websites. When it comes <br>
  to coding, developers will be needed more when <br>
  companies want to create apps.  </p>
